            <p>"Some people don't like change, but you need to embrace change if the alternative is disaster." "When I was in college, I wanted to be involved in things that would change the world." "I think life on Earth must be about more than just solving problems ... It's got to be something inspiring, even if it is vicarious."</p>

        <h3>Timeline</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Jun 28, 1971</b><br>Elon Reeve Musk was born in Pretoria, Transvaal, South Africa, the son of Maye Musk and Errol Musk</li>
            <li><b>1983</b><br>He teaches himself computer programming at the age of 12, sold the code for a BASIC-based video game he created called Blastar, for approximately $500</li>    
            <li><b>Mar 1999</b><br>Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, with US$10 million from the sale of Zip. One year later, the company merged with Confinity, which had a money transfer service called PayPal. The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001</li> 
            <li><b>Oct 2002</b><br>PayPal was acquired by eBay for US$1.5 billion in stock. With US$100 million of his early fortune, in May, Musk founded SpaceX to revolutionize space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets</li> 
            <li><b>Feb 2004</b><br>Musk invests in Tesla, an electic-vehicle company, joining Tesla's board of directors as its chairman. He took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design at a detailed level</li>    
            <li><b>Mar 2006</b><br>
                SpaceX's first ever rocket launched and exploded. He started to invest in SolarCity. The underlying motivation for funding both SolarCity and Tesla is to help combat global warming, and to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy</li> 
            <li><b>2008</b><br>In August, SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket had failed all three of its launches. SpaceX and Tesla were both running out of cash. According to Musk, he says: "We had virtually no money... a fourth failure would have been absolutely game over. Done." In September, the fourth launch succeeds. On Dec. 23, NASA awarded SpaceX a $1.6 billion contract to haul at least 20 metric tons of cargo to the international space station over 12 planned flights. Likewise, hours before Tesla would have gone bankrupt - they managed to raise funds</li> 
            <li><b>May 22, 2012</b><br>SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft delivered cargo to and from the International Space Station â€” a challenging feat previously accomplished only by governments. Tesla starts shipping the model S at $75,000 in June, and launches supercharger network for long distance driving</li> 
            <li><b>2014</b><br>Starts building the Gigafactory to mass produce batteries</li> 
            <li><b>2015</b><br>Unveils Powerwall. First customers get their Model X. In June, rocket launch fails, the first failure after 19 successful launches. In Dec, rocket landing succeeds - the first reusuable rocket to reach orbit</li> 
            <li><b>Dec 2016</b><br>Launches largest rocket Falcon Heavy</li> 
            <li><b>Mar 2017</b><br>SpaceX makes aerospace history by flying and reflying an orbital class booster, which is the most expensive part of the rocket. Gigafactory starts production in June. In July, Tesla's first customers get their Model 3 - at $35,000 per car.</li>
